 # Normal Sorting Algorithms 
 
       1. Selection Sort  - TC -> O(n^2) worst and best   || Space Complexity -> O(1)
       2. Bubble Sort     - TC -> O(n^2) worst, O(n) best || Space Complexity -> O(1)
       3. Insertion Sort  - TC -> O(n^2) worst, O(n) best || Space Complexity -> O(1)

 # Sorting based on Divide and Conquers \ Recursion

         # 1. Merge Sort  - TC -> O(nlogn) worst and best || Space Complexity -> O(n)
         # 2.
